##Product Vision

For college students who want to be more organized in both individual and teamwork. The product, Sirius, is a scheduler/personal organizer that allows for an internal and public schedule and to-do list. Unlike When2meet, our Product has functionality to set priorities on our schedule items, so that individuals can keep their to-do lists prioritized and groups can choose meetings times that are most optimal for everyone.

Evolved into a more personal-facing application, with higher priority on scheduling and to-do list features, with some sharing functionality also added.
